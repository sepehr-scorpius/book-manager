# ðŸ§® Project 4: Book Library Manager

This project is a basic **Python library management system** that allows users to:

- Add books with a title, author, year, and rating (1â€“5)
- View all books in the collection
- Search for a book by title
- Delete a book by title  
- Automatically save and load data using `JSON`  

All data is stored in a `library.json` file, making the library persistent between runs.
